# An Unofficial Archive of the [QUT Timetable Planner](https://timetable-planner.apps.qut.edu.au/)

This is an unofficial archive, it is in no way officially affiliated with QUT. While it still works as of Semester 1 2024, it may break at any time. I will likely be unable to fix it if it does break.

## Cloudflare Pages

There is a Cloudflare Pages deployment at [https://qut-timetable-planner.pages.dev/](https://qut-timetable-planner.pages.dev/), for an easily accessible version.

## Running Locally

I am using a proxy to get around CORS issues, so you will need to run the proxy+web server locally.

```sh
python3 start_server.py
```
